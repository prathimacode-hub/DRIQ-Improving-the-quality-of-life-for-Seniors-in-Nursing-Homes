# DRIQ - Improving The Quality Of Life For Seniors in Nursing Homes

Without monitoring technology in nursing homes, the staff cannot determine the status of the seniors and whether they have been lying down with a wet diaper for hours. Consequently, this issue impacts their quality of life, placing them at significant risk for skin breakdown and life-threatening urinary tract infections. Impact-driven startup Driq HealthÂ´s non-contact sensor monitoring can solve this by allowing real-time notifications for timely diaper changes as well as providing mobility alerts.
